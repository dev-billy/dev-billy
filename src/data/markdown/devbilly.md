My website comes from working on projects on [frontendmentor](https://frontendmentor.io) and decided it was time to start building a site where i could showcase all the projects i have built and document my journey.

Working on this project, i was able to loop in markdown to share my project story and it something i always wanted to do, i think i would go further on this site and update here ðŸ˜Š

I started off working this website to try and recreate a design i saw on frontend mentor by designing it on figma and the rest is what we have here.
I have previously struggled in getting on a personal website that i fully like but I have a great feeling about this one.

Hope you loved my design and if you have any feedback please feel free to let me know.
