This project for tracking ip addresses and domain names was a frontend challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io).

Frontend Mentor is a platform that helps you practice building websites by following a design and project brief.

Creating this project has helped me work on my skills as a frontend developer to use my knowledge on layouts to create an interesting design but also using my javascript knowledge to use the [ipify API](https://geo.ipify.org/) to get data for the ip address and domain.

Also through the journey i learnt on how api keys work in local environment and how to deploy them in a production environment and use the tools provided by [vercel.io](https://vercel.io).
