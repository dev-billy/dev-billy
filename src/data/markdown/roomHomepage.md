This project for a landing page of a hypothetical furniture store was a frontend challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io).

Frontend Mentor is a platform that helps you practice building websites by following a design and project brief.

Creating this project has helped me refine my workflow and exposed me to work with more interesting layouts and challenge my responsive web design skills.While working on this project, I got to experience the beauty of flexbox in making layouts easy and using javascript in making the website more interactive.
